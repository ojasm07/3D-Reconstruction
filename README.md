# 3D-Reconstruction Using Images/ Video
Computer Vision, SFM, RANSAC, Python

Performed SIFT on sets of pairs of images for feature matching.
Using the calculated Calibration, Fundamental, Essential and Camera matrix, performed triangulation to get 3D coordinates
along with their corresponding RGB values to get a sparse 3D reconstruction.
